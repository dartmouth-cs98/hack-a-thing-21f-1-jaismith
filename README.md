# QR Codes and Web Sockets

## What you built? 

QR codes are a great way of linking physical resources to online platforms (or accessing desktop data from mobile platforms!). This hackathing is a demo in procedurally generating QR codes linked to database resources, and registering in real-time when they are scanned. This gives us a powerful authentication-free data link between either physical resources (printed QR codes) and dynamically generated online QR codes (like this site).

## Who Did What?

I worked indendently on this exercise.

## What you learned

QR codes are very easy to procedurally generate! Providing realtime feedback as they are scanned makes for quite a satisfying interface :).

N/A, found a QR code package on NPM and read through Firestore documentation to refresh myself on how realtime updates worked.
